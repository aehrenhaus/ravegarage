		<ol>
			<li>Right click the Features folder in Medidata.RBT.Common.Steps project. Add new 
				item</li>
			<li>You shall see 3 new templates if you installed specflow<br />
				Choose the feature file template, name it myfeature.feature<br />
				<img src="02/specflow template.jpg"  alt="template" /><br />
				Enter the following text<br />
				<img src="02/sample feature.jpg"  alt="sample feature" /><br />
				
			</li>
			<li>Compile (F6) ,go to test view window, <br />
			<img src="02/sample feature testview.jpg" alt="test view" /><br />
				Here<br />
				Group name = Class name = &#39;MyFeatureTitleFeature&#39;
				<br />
				Test =Method name = &#39;MyScenarioTitle&#39;&nbsp;
				<br />
				<br />
				Class name comes from the first line after &#39;Feature:&#39;&nbsp; , camelized<br />
				Method name comes from the first line after &#39;Scenario:&#39; ,camelized<br />
			
			</li>
			<li>Run it , you will see it takes you the the url.<br />
				&#39;I navigate to url &quot;&quot; &#39; is a defined step.<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				As a programmer you should write and maintain these steps defintions.<br />
				A step definition is a method marked by an attribute, see examples later.<br />
				<br />
				As a SQA, you can write steps in the feature file that <strong>does or does not</strong> have a 
				matched step definition. If it does not , find a programmer to implement the 
				match for the step.<br />
				<br />
				A step in the scenario that does not have a step definition 
				will not cause compiler to fail but will cause the test 
				to fail.<br />
