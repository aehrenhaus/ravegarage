			01 Project setup</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Uninstall Typemock 6.0.2 which is usually installed on medidata&#39;s machines, it 
				conflicts with the version of selenium we are using.</li>
			<li>Install specflow, this will provide nessisary plugins for VS2010</li>
			<li>Clone RBT project using git</li>
			<li>Get your self a copy of firefox12. At this time, only firefox 12 works properly 
				with the selenium dlls.</li>
			<li>In ravegarage\Medidata.RBT.Features.Rave folder, make a copy of 
				App.config.template ,rename the new file to App.config</li>
			<li>Now you can open the solution, and edit app.config.<ol>
			<li>Config your path to the copy of firefox browser</li>
				<li>Optionally you can config the path to the firefox&#39;s profile folder. There is a 
					zipped copy in ExternalDlls folder.
					<br />
					This profile contains firebug.<br />
					With a blank profile setting, eachtime there will be a new profile generated and 
					you won&#39;t get any of you plugins installed to other firefox.</li>
				<li>Config the rave url and database connection strings</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Open the solution in VS, compile it(F6), open &#39;test view&#39;&nbsp; if you don&#39;t see 
				it(Menu: Test-&gt;Windows-&gt;TestView)<br />
				There should already be many tests there .<br />
				Click the group by dropdown to group by Class<br />
				<img src="01/test view group by.jpg"  alt="group by" /></li>
			<li>
				Pick any test , right click and run it. It might fail but at least you should 
				see browser pops up trying to run the test.
