		<h1>
			03 Existing steps</h1>
		<p>
			Step definitions are .net methods with an attribute on it. The attribute gives 
			the match information.<br />
			<strong>I the later text, &#39;step&#39; can mean either the &#39;step in feature file&#39; or 
			the &#39;step definition method&#39; depending on the context.</strong></p>
		<p>
			There are common steps a well as steps only for domain(Rave).<br />
			You can find them in
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Medidata.RBT.Common.Steps</li>
			<li>Medidata.RBT.Features.Rave</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Common steps can be used for any sites</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I click &quot;Commit&quot; button</li>
			<li>I navigate to url &quot;http://www.bing.com&quot;</li>
			<li>I switch to &quot;Targeted SDV Study Plan&quot; window<br />
				<br />
				Although the value inside quotes is a rave thing, the step it self is 
				indeed a common 
				step.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Steps for Rave is Rave specific:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Then I verify that Tiers in subject override table are not in the following 
				order
				<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Tier Name | Row |<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; All Forms | 1 |<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | No Forms | 2 |</li>
			<li>And I select Report &quot;Targeted SDV Configuration&quot;</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>
			3 ways to learn about existing steps:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Read existing feature files. </li>
			<li>Read step definition methods. </li>
			<li>Read the step definition report in Medidata.RBT.Documents<br />
				Run this project to update report , 
				then open the report in Templates folder.<br />

		</ul>
	
		<h2>
			Guidelines for choosing a step</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Prefer using existing steps than writing a new step.<br />
				<br />
				For example if you want to verify the study dropdown exists, use the common 
				step:<br />
				<strong>I verify control &quot;Study&quot; exists</strong><br />
				Don&#39;t write your step:<strong>
				<br />
				I verify the study dropdown exists.</strong><br />
				<br />
				To programmers:<br />
				Step defs can be very adaptive because in most cases they are calling virtual 
				methods on page object or interface methods under the hood.<br />
				In the case that a step does a very similar thing but not excatly the what you 
				want on a page, you can provide a override of such method on page object rather 
				than writting a new step.<br />
				<img src="03/IChooseFrom.jpg" /><br />
				<br />
				For example:<br />
				There is a common step: <strong>I choose &quot;value&quot; from &quot;dropdown identifier&quot;</strong><br />
				This step can choose text from a standard dropdown, but on your page the 
				dropdown is a composite control.<br />
				In this case , instead of write a new step <strong>I choose &quot;value&quot; from composite 
				dropdown &quot;identifier&quot;</strong>, you provide an override of ChooseFromDropdown(identifier, text) method on your 
				page object.<br />
				If the composite control appears on many pages of your site, you can override 
				this method in a base class.</li>
			<li>Prefer writing a common step def than writing a domain specific step, if you 
				have to write a new step<br />
				Just keep in mind that the step is common, others can share you method in 
				similar situations. So often you will call a virtual or interface method rather 
				than non-virtual one.</li>
			<li>Finally, if you have to write a new domain specific step, the literal should be very specifc to 
				describe your domain-specific problem. Don&#39;t let it looks like a common method.</li>
		</ul>
