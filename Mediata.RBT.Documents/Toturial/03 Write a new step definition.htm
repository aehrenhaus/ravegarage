			03 Write a new step definition</h1>
		<p>
			In the previous example, you created a new feature file.
			<br />
			And there is only 1 scenario in the feature file.<br />
			And there is only 1 step in the scenario.<br />
			And the step has a definition, you can verify this by right clicking the step 
			and &#39;Go to definition&#39; (or just F12)<br />
			<img src="03/Go to definition.jpg" alt="test view" /><br />
			When you run the test, it will take you to the specified url. ( this is the 
			expected behavior of the step)</p>
		<p>
			This part, you will write a step that does not have definition, and write step 
			definition for it.<br />
