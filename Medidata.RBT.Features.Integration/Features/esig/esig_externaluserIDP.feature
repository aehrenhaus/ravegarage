# Users: eSignature Request for Authentication by external user
#Rave allows for eSignatures to be applied to Forms, Folders and Subjects, as well as eLearning confirmation pages. 
#As part of Raveâ€™s current user authentication model, the user submits their eSignature credentials as a binding eSignature in Rave. For all externally authenticated users, the eSignature credentials will be passed to iMedidata CAS for verification. iMedidata CAS will process verification requests for all external users, including those authenticated by independent, third-party Identity Providers (IDP). The PIN Code on iMedidata serves as a PIN on Rave. 
#Note: For the purposes of this feature, an external user is defined as any user that is authenticated by a system other than Rave, including iMedidata and trusted, third-party IDPs (Identity Providers). Tests done for iMedidata users will adequately test the same functionality for an IDP user 1. If any explicit functional differences exist between iMedidata and IDP, they will be explicity called out where they are known to exist.
#Rave supports two types of eSignature methods. The old style eSignature which is built into the eCRF form using an eSig field OID, which is being deprecated beginning in Rave 5.6.4 patch 9. This signature method relies on credentials residing in the Rave database or direct API communication to mimic the credentials being stored in the Rave database for performing the verification to support eSignatures which validate individual datapoints. Old style signature fields will not support external eSignature attempts for IDP user 1s, but iMedidata users will be able to sign these fields individually. Batch signing of old style signatures is not supported for external users, including iMedidata users.
#The new style eSignature, which resides at the form level, offers the flexibility to use iMedidata CAS to authenticate or verify user credentials. These form level verfications provide a more efficient means of bulk signing and do not require individual datapoint verification.
# The new style signatures will leverage the Sign and Save eSignature method of verifying and applying an eSignature to the form (or forms) before saving changes. A modal window will be used to present the signature request and to capture the credentials for verification. If verification succeeds, data is saved and the eSignature is applied to all new style forms. 
#Verification messages between iMedidata and Rave will be goverened by the SAML protocol which will provide either a success message or a lockout message. iMedidata CAS will broker verification attempts for IDP user 1s through SAML requests sent to the IDP. IDP responses will be passed back to Rave through iMedidata CAS.
#Rave will not capture eSignature authentication attempts for external users; the responsibility for tracking verification attempts will lie with the identity provider (iMedidata or IDP) who also determines the verification criteria and the lockout threshold. By default, iMedidata sets a failure threshold of 5 failed attempts before the user is locked out. iMedidata users will now be able to fail 5 signature attempts before hitting the threshold. Each IDP will set its own lockout threshold and that threshold will be respected for signature attempts made in Rave. 
#eSignature failure messages and audit failure messages will be simplified so that users are not given information that would compromise Rave security. Audit success messages will be simplified and unified to match the failure messages and to accurately reflect the message content defined by the SAML protocol. 


Feature: eSignature for external user
	As an externally authenticated user, I want to apply an electronic signature to forms from form level, calendar view and grid view for a study with only with Rave new style signatures 

	
Background:
	Given I am an IDP user
	And my username is <IDP User 1>
	And my password is <Password1>
	And I am assigned to a Study Group <Study Group 1>
	And I am assigned to a study <Study A> that is in <Study Group 1>
	And I am assigned to a site <Site A1> that is in <Study A> in <Study Group 1>
	And I have been assigned to the EDC app
	And I have been invited to the Data Manager role for site <Site A1> that is in <Study A> in <Study Group 1>
	And I have been given sign permissions to site <Site A1> that is in <Study A> in <Study Group 1>
	And I have been given batch sign permissions to site <Site A1> that is in <Study A> in <Study Group 1>
