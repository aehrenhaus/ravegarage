#Rave allows for eSignatures to be applied to Forms, Folders and Subjects, as well as eLearning confirmation pages. As part of Raveâ€™s current user authentication model, the user submits their eSignature credentials as a binding eSignature in Rave.
#Rave supports two types of eSignature methods. The old style eSignature which is built into the eCRF form using an eSig field OID, which is being deprecated beginning in Rave 5.6.4 patch 9. This signature method relies on credentials residing in the Rave database or direct API communication to mimic the credentials being stored in the Rave database for performing the verification to support eSignatures which validate individual datapoints.
#The new style eSignature, which resides at the form level, offers the flexibility to use iMedidata CAS to authenticate or verify user credentials. These form level verfications provide a more eficient means of bulk signing and do not require individual datapoint verification.
# The new style signatures will leverage the Sign and Save eSignature method of verifying and applying an eSignature to the form (or forms) before saving changes. A modal window will be used to present the signature request and to capture the credentials for verification. If verification succeeds, data is saved and the eSignature is applied to all new style forms. If verification should fail, the signature is not applied, no selections or changes are saved and the modal window can be closed. All selections made prior to the modal opening are persisted and the user may choose to Save or Cancel without applying an eSignature. By default, Rave sets a failure threshold of 3 failed attempts before the user is locked out. This rule remains in effect.
#eSignature failure messages and audit failure messages will be simplified so that users are not given information that would compromise Rave security. Audit success messages will be simplified and unified to match the failure messages and to accurately reflect the message content defined by the SAML protocol.
