		<h1>Page object(PO) pattern</h1>
		<p>Page object pattern means for each page there is a class represents it.</p>
		<p>Simple operation such as clicking a button or business level opertion such as 
            uploading a draft can be encapsulated into a method in PO class. </p>
        <p>With PO class 
            in hand , we usually <strong>don&#39;t operate the page in step definitions</strong>, instead, we 
            call methods on page object instance( the CurrentPage variable ) and let it do 
            the operations.</p>

        <p>
            In RBT project, all PO classes inherit from IPage, there could be some base 
            classes in between your PO class and IPage, for example: PageBase, RavePageBase, 
            EDCPageBase. Read these classes is helpful to understand the project.</p>
        <p>
            When designing your own PO classes, there are some guidelines</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1</li>
            <li>2</li>
            <li>3</li>
        </ul>
