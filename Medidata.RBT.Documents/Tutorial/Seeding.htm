		<h1>Seeding</h1>
		<p>For some tests there should be some data pre exists in the system. For example a&nbsp; 
            study and an assignment must exist in order to test a DT. The insertion of these 
            data is called seeding.</p>
        <p>Problem is how to insert them. There were many debates about the way to do it. I 
            don&#39;t want to tell the whole story, but here are some options given:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use sql to seed database directly. (have to know every details of how rave 
                operates the db)</li>
            <li>Use Rave&#39;s core objects. ( have to reference Rave code base)</li>
            <li>Write steps in RBT to seed from UI </li>
            <li>Seed manually from UI, and save the database , and restore it before every test 
                (Too many databases to backup, also you can not use a shared site any more 
                ,becuase you can&#39;t recover the db that others are using)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are other problems like shall the seeded data be cleaned?&nbsp; How to 
            clean up the seeded data?</p>
        <p>
            Finally one day some smart developers come up with a brilliant idea, a feasible 
            method, and that becomes our seeding methodology today.</p>
        <p>
            The idea is to seed from Rave UI with object oriented code in RBT project.&nbsp; 
            Most of seeding take advantage of Rave&#39;s uploading function. In Rave you can 
            create Projects, Users, Sites etc by uploading xml files.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are some presets of xml files in RBT files. When the seeding step 
            executes, it&#39;s going to make a copy of such a file, modify it to make it unique 
            (for example unique username for User xml) and navigate to upload page to upload 
            the file.</p>
