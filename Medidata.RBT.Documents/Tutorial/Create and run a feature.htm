			<li>Right click the Features folder in Medidata.RBT.Common.Steps project. Add new 
				item</li>
			<li>You shall see 3 new templates if you installed specflow<br />
				Choose the feature file template, name it myfeature.feature<br />
				<img src="Create and run a feature/specflow template.jpg"  alt="template" /><br />
				Enter the following text<br />
				<img src="Create and run a feature/sample feature.jpg"  alt="sample feature" /><br />
				
			</li>
			<li>Compile (F6) ,go to test view window, <br />
			<img src="Create and run a feature/sample feature testview.jpg" alt="test view" /><br />
				As you can see, the feature names in the list come from the first line after &#39;Feature:&#39;&nbsp; , 
				spaces taken out, camelized<br />
				And scenario names come from the first line after &#39;Scenario:&#39; , spaces 
				taken out, camelized<br />
			
			</li>
			<li>Run it , you will see it takes you the the url.<br />
				<strong>I navigate to url &quot;...&quot;</strong>&nbsp; is an exisiting step definition, 
				that&#39;s why your feature works<br />
				<br />
				<strong>A step in feature doesn&#39;t have to have a 
				matched step definition.</strong> If it does not , the project will still build, 
				but test shall fail, and in the report you should know that the step definition 
				is missing.
				<br />
				<br />
				In such case,&nbsp; find a programmer to implement the 
				definition method.<br />
				As a programmer you should write and maintain these steps defintions.<br />
				A step definition is a method marked by an attribute, see examples later.<br />
